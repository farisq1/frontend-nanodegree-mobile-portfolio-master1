# Hello this is the Optimization project.

## Optimization is to make your website fast as possible.


## What i have done in the index is i have minimzed the CSS and used it in the Index file and i also have removed the google font and removed the script 
## (<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>)
## And for the views i have edited the javascript file and in the function change pizza size i have declared 3 variables
## and changed in the loop in order to make the pizza change size and make the speed under 5 ms

## and in the function UpdatePositions i have taken the scrollTop and declared phase and called it inside the function
## This is pretty much what i have done so far.



### 1-open the index.html file to check the website
### 2- test the speed on google page speed test 

## Pizza:
### 1- open the pizza file
### 2- check devtools for the FPS meter
### 3- try the pizza slider

## That's pretty much it if there is something to add please notify me.


## Thank you.
## Regards Faris.
