Hello this is the Optimization project.

Optimization is to make your website fast as possible.


What i have done in the index is i have minimzed the CSS and used it in the Index file and i also have removed the google font and removed the script 
(<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>)
And for the views i have edited the javascript file and in the function change pizza size i have declared 3 variables
and changed in the loop in order to make the pizza change size and make the speed under 5 ms

and in the function UpdatePositions i have taken the scrollTop and declared phase and called it inside the function
This is pretty much what i have done so far.

To start the website you click on the index and the website shows up and when you go to (views > pizza) and open the pizza file it will show you the website for the pizza and you can check the FPS meter


That's pretty much it if there is something to add please notify me.


Thank you.
Regards Faris.
